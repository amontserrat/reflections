- When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  -> Creating a remote repository allows for several people working on the same project from different computers. It also allows one single person working on his/her personal project from different computers. For example from the work office and from home.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	-> Because then I can decide when to pull some changes. I t could happen that some changes are broken or they are not definitely, so I can pull then changes when I'm sure they represent some sort of final version.
