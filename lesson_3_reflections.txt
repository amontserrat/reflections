- When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  -> Creating a remote repository allows for several people working on the same project from different computers. It also allows one single person working on his/her personal project from different computers. For example from the work office and from home.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	-> Because then I can decide when to pull some changes. I t could happen that some changes are broken or they are not definitely, so I can pull then changes when I'm sure they represent some sort of final version.

- Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	-> Fork is used to copy one repository from one GitHub account to your GitHub account. In this case a reference to the original repository is included, so one can alway know who is the original author. Clone, instead, is used to copy one repository to your local directory

- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	-> One benefit is that in case changes were made to both the local and the remote repositories since the last sync, when pulling the last commits from the remote, these can be fetched into the local following the last known state of the remote. This makes possible to compare your last state of the master with the last pulled commits, before deciding to merge them or not.
